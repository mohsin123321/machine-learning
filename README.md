# Machine Learning Algorithms 
## 1) Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression implemented in Python from sratch. It uses gradient decent approach for the convergence of the model and uses the titanic data to calculate the probability of survivals.

## 2) Naive Bayes Algorithm
We used Naive Bayes classifier to predict the sentiments of the reviews, based on IMDB dataset , to predict them deemed negative or positive.
