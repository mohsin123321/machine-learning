# Machine Learning 
Machine Learning Curiculum that contains machine learning algorithms and their detailed decriptions. An overview of the projects are given below:-

## 1) Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression implemented in Python from sratch. It uses gradient decent approach for the convergence of the model and uses the titanic data to calculate the probability of survivals.

## 2) Naive Bayes Classifier
